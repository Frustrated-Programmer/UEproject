<img src="./logo.png"><br>
A game about two entities that move as one, split apart and trying to reach each other.


For the 2019 summer DevJam.

# TODO
 * GUIS
   - Menu's Background
   - ***Possibly:*** Better font's than what I've added.
   - ***Possibly:*** Story Gui
 * Sounds for:
   - When player lands on goal
   - When both players lands on a goal.
   - Board rotating to see other side
   - Timer done counting down.
 * ***Possibly:***  The bottom part of the logo for REFLECT have a distorted watery look so it actually looks like it's "REFLECT"ed
 * ***Possibly:*** Make the characters actually look like entities
 * ***Possibly:*** Upgrade the logo so it looks cooler than it already is.
