# TODO
 * Models for:
   - PowerPad / A pressure plate than only WHEN a player is on it does it power a gate.
   - Lever / A lever thats on directional. Can only turn off/on depending on direction player came from.
   - No-Name-Yet / A lever that turns on/off no matter where the player came from.
   - Goal / the spot where both players need to go to. (Goals do not need to be on same square.
   - Gates / A doorway that opens when it is powered.
   - Start / The place where players spawn at. (Starts do not need to be on same square)
   - Timer / When player leaves the pad it stays powered for a duration of moves.
 * GUIS
   - Menu's Background

   - ***Possibly:*** Better font's than what I've added.

   - PowerPad being un-pressed
   - Lever switching
   - No-Name-Yet switching (could be same sound as lever)
   - When player lands on goal
   - When both players lands on a goal.
   - Board rotating to see other side
   - Players moving
   - Timer counting down
   - Players spawning

 * ***Possibly:***  The bottom part of the logo for REFLECT have a distorted watery look so it actually looks like it's "REFLECT"ed
 * Currently the player can differentiate what powers what by a SHAPE on the pad/gate. Make custom shapes instead of using basic square/circle/stars
 * ***Possibly:*** Make the characters actually look like entities
 * Change camera's height depending on width/height of the level.
 * ***Possibly:*** Upgrade the logo so it looks cooler than it already is.
